# ***HTML Links***
##  Why is the link special?
### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
## Writing links
### Links are created using the <***a***> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <***a***> tag and the closing <***/a***> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute

### look for this example

#  CSS Layout
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
### Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Containing Elements If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


## Controlling the Position of Elements
### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.


## The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts.

* article - Defines an independent, self-contained * content
* aside - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* footer - Defines a footer for a document or a section

#  JS Functions
## Why do we need to js ?
### We need Java to make the page more dynamic and attractive to the user.In order for the user to interact with it and feel comfortable in it

## WHAT IS the  FUNCTION IN JS ?
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function 

## How we can declerating a function and call it 
* function name_fun()
 { console.log(‘hello’); }

*  name_fun();
