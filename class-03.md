# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow


## HTML provides us with three different types of lists:
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. The ordered list is created with the <**ol**> element. Each item in the list is placed between an opening <**li**> tagand a closing <**/li**> tag. You can put a second list inside an <**li**> element to create a sublist or nested list.
* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point. The unordered list is created with the <**ul**> element. Each item in the list is placedbetween an opening <**li**> tag and a closing <**/li**> tag.
* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. The definition list is created with the <**dl**>element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the <**dl**>element you will usually see pairs of <**dt**> and <**dd**> elements. the <**dt**> is used to contain the term being defined, and <**dd**> is used to contain the definition.

## BORDER , MARGIN & PADDING 
### Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance :
- ***BORDER*** Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be O pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
- ***MARGIN*** Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
- ***PADDING*** Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

# notes 
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
*  You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. 
*  You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
*  It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties. 
*  Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, inline boxes made into block-level boxes. 
*  Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading. 
*  CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

## Chapter 2 ***Basic JavaScript Instructions***
### ARRAYS
* An array is a special type of variable. It doesnâ€™t just store one value; it stores a list of values.
* You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.

### SWITCH STATEMENTS
#### A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
